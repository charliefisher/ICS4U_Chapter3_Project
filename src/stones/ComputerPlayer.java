	 * This class is framework for where I would implement an AI
	 * I ended up not having enough time and thus could not do it
	 * 
	 * It would simply have to wait for the human player to remove a number that is not a multiple of 3
	 * From here it would remove enough stones such that the sum of both players move was a multiple of 3
	 * It would do this until there a few enough stones that it can win the game
